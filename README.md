Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.  Each input would have exactly one solution, not use the same element twice.    Example 1:  Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
